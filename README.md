# fluxcell

fluxcell is a bot, messaging platform, database and search engine rolled into one. Its designed to support sustainable self-organization, by helping you tune where and how your data is stored, transformed and modeled. Importantly, we strive towards a powerful and security minded role-based organization system to help you see who has what level of access to your data.

This is in early development, not really usable.
